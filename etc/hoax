# Hi there! This is an example of what is the syntax of a etc/hoax file.
# In general it is quite similar to the classic etc/hosts but here
# each entry can be associated to one explicit FQDN or a glob-based FQDN

# when using this tool you are assuming that any damage, data loss or even
# law infringements that some wrong action taken by you could cause is of
# your entire resposibility.

# IPv6 or IPv4 address          FQDN or a glob based on a FQDN, btw, this is a commentary! ;)
