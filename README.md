# Macgonuts

``Macgonuts`` is an ``ARP/NDS`` swiss army knife to make ``MAC addresses`` going nuts on networks around!

It supports ``IPv4/ARP`` and ``IPv6/NDP``.  It intends to bring you all in a shell. Anything related to
spoofing layer-2 addresses can be done elegantly with a single f_cking nice ``non-scripted`` tool, a
badass executable without clumsy zillions of dependencies. Suckless is the key here.

Anyway, if you want to do spoof from your own code, you can still use ``Macgonuts`` as a ``C library`` or ``Go``,
``Python`` bind as well.
