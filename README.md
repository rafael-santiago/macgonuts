# Macgonuts

``Macgonuts`` is an ``ARP/NDS`` swiss army knife to make ``MAC addresses`` going nuts on networks around!

It supports ``IPv4/ARP`` and ``IPv6/NDP``.  It intends to bring you all in a shell. Anything related to
spoofing layer-2 addresses can be done elegantly with a single f_cking nice ``non-scripted`` tool, a
badass executable without clumsy zillions of dependencies. Suckless is the key here.

Anyway, if you want to do spoof from your own code, you can still use ``Macgonuts`` as a ``C library`` or ``Go``,
``Python`` bind as well.

You should take your first steps [here](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/macgonuts/blob/main/doc.BUILD) and so
buckle up and quickly mastering all the tool [here](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/macgonuts/blob/main/MANUAL.md).

I hope you like it, enjoy!

**Bear in mind**: Use this software at your own responsability and risk. I am not responsible for any misuse of it,
including some kind of damage, data loss etc. Sniffing network, eavesdropping people without them knowing is wrong
and a crime. Do not be a jerk, respect people rights. This tool was written with the intention of being a support
tool to test and promote security on networks through pentesting stuff, ethical hacking and also a practice tool for
computer networking courses. You should use this tool only into well controlled environments. If you will run ``Macgonuts``
on public networks, be sure of warning network users of your actions before. Also be sure of loading your ``ethics.ko``
module before any network hacking action. Finally, this software is provided with no warranty.

Again, ``Macgonuts`` is an ``ARP/NDS`` swiss army knife with batteries included but ethics you need to bring it from home.
